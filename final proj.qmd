## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
install.packages('scales')


adopt <- read_csv(here::here("Finalproj", "data", "Adoptable_Pets.csv"))
tbl_summary(adopt)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
tbl_summary(
  adopt,
  by = 'Intake Type',
  include = c('Animal Type', 'Pet Age', Breed, Sex,
  'Zip Codes',
  Municipalities))

```

Creating a categorical variable for Pet Age
```{r}
if 'Pet Age' = 
```
